Building a full employee management application with different permissions and functionalities requires careful planning and consideration. Here are some key ideas to include in your application:

1. User Roles and Permissions: Implement a role-based access control system where users are assigned specific roles (e.g., admin, manager, employee) with different permissions. Define what each role can and cannot do within the application.

2. Authentication and Authorization: Implement a secure authentication mechanism, such as username and password or even multi-factor authentication, to ensure that only authorized users can access the application. Perform authorization checks to enforce user permissions for different functionalities.

3. Employee Profiles: Create a feature to manage employee profiles. This includes capturing and storing employee details such as name, contact information, position, department, and any other relevant information.

4. Leave Management: Develop a module for employees to request and manage leaves. Include features for submitting leave requests, tracking leave balances, and handling approval workflows for managers and administrators.

5. Attendance and Time Tracking: Implement a system to track employee attendance and working hours. This can include features like clock-in/clock-out functionality, timesheet management, and reporting capabilities.

6. Performance Management: Build a performance management module to track employee performance, set goals, conduct performance evaluations, and provide feedback. This can involve features like goal setting, performance appraisal forms, and performance metrics tracking.

7. Task and Project Management: Include features to assign tasks and projects to employees, track progress, and monitor deadlines. This can help manage workflow and collaboration within the organization.

8. Payroll and Compensation: Develop functionality to handle payroll processing and compensation management. This includes calculating salaries, managing deductions, generating pay stubs, and handling tax-related processes.

9. Training and Development: Implement a module to manage employee training and development activities. This can include features like training program registration, tracking completion of courses, and monitoring skill development.

10. Reporting and Analytics: Incorporate reporting and analytics capabilities to provide insights into employee data, such as attendance records, performance metrics, leave trends, and other key metrics. This can help in making data-driven decisions and assessing the overall performance of the organization.

Remember to tailor these ideas to your specific requirements and the scale of your employee management application.
